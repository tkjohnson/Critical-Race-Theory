<h1> ‘Being weaponized’: Students, teachers of color discuss ‘critical race theory’, history in classrooms</h1>

<h2> Critical race theory has crept up as a political issue in most school districts across the country as some legislators have introduced bills banning it from being taught in K-12 schools—such as in Texas and Alabama </h2>

<p>According to Britannica, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-race-theory">critical race theory</a> is an academic and legal theory which examines systemic racism and how it’s affected the United States through social, political and economic means. The theory is mainly taught in higher education courses such as political science and law.</p>

<p>Some worry that critical race theory being taught in primary and secondary schools, teaching white students to hate themselves and their heritage while others believe it isn’t being discussed at this level of education. New York City education officials say they do not teach critical race theory in their schools.
</p>

<p> Westenley Alcenat, an African-American studies professor at Fordham University said it’s a teacher’s role to help Black and brown students understand how institutional racism has shaped this country. Alcenat believes most critics who say that critical race theory is being taught in primary and secondary schools are lying and wish to uphold a specific narrative of American history. He also admitted not using the theory for most of his undergraduate courses.
 </p>

<p>“If it were, indeed, a debate about critical race theory and history, then we would be actually discussing curriculum, not the perception of a racial boogeyman in the curriculum..” Alcenat said.</p>

<p>Tierra LeGrand is a social studies teacher who works at P.S. 126 Dr. Marjorie H Dunbar. LeGrand finds most of her students excited to learn about relevant topics that are occurring in society so they have a better understanding of themselves and identity.</p>

<p>“It's empowering for me to teach my students and it’s empowering when I see they're taking information and really internalizing that to bring about change,” LeGrand said.</p>

<p> Data provided by the New York City Department of Education show a large percentage of Black students in Brooklyn school districts 16,17,18 and 23 with students ranging from 70 to 80% identifying as Black. </p>

<p> Some argue it is extremely important for these students to learn their history in order to move forward and understand how this country views them. </p>

<p>“It's really just between two visions, a vision that is a multiracial democracy versus a vision that is—a democracy limited to only the privileged view,” Alcenat said.</p>
